Note: Programs which are available to your cli in any directory are kept in /usr/local/bin
      So you can move program files to this folder, for programs you want accessible to you
      from anywher in your cli. And to ensure you don't get blocked from permissions use chmod +x applicationOrFileName


Move a file/folder to another folder:

    mv ../source_file.file ../destination_folder
