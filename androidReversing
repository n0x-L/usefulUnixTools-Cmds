Lab Setup:
1. Install java jdk
2. Install apktool, put in /usr/local/bin
3. Install dex2jar, put in /usr/local/bin, run chmod +x as needed
4. Install jd-gui

Step 1:
To use apktool to decompile apk, go to folder with .apk files, in terminal type:
apktool d 269227c4c4770e109e53c6cf87bd9bde367843c4806f5975c5aa317f318e28a9.apk
(you can use tab to autocomplete when you start type the name of the apk "26...tab")

Step 2: use dex2jar to convert bytecode file to jar
To view all dex2jar operations, use ls in usr/local/bin. They are all prefixed with 'd2j-'
We use d2j-dex2jar.sh which is a bash script that will convert our dex file into a jar file
-chmod +x d2j-*.sh to ensure we can run the bash script
-type in commands:
	sh d2j-dex2jar.sh -f path_to_apk_file.apk 

Step 3: View jar in jd-gui


---------------------
Dex2Jar cmds:

d2j-* -h : help
d2j-smali -o myNewDexFileName path/to/smali/folder/or/file : convert a smali file (or folder) to a dex file
dex2jar -f ../path/to/.apk/file : convert dex file to jar file
